# Known Limitations and Potential Unknowns for Docker Compose Support

Based on the implementation and documentation, here's a comprehensive analysis of current limitations and potential issues that may arise:

## üö® Known Limitations

### Architecture & Deployment
- **Single VM constraint**: All containers run on the same machine with shared resources
- **No horizontal scaling**: Cannot scale individual services independently across multiple machines
- **Single build service**: Only one service can have a build section (prevents ambiguous build contexts)
- **No container-to-container volumes**: Shared volumes between containers are not supported
- **Maximum container limit**: Constrained by VM CPU/memory resources

### Networking & Service Discovery
- **No custom networks**: Docker Compose networks are ignored (containers use localhost)
- **No external networks**: All networking is internal to the VM
- **Port conflict potential**: Multiple services binding to the same port will conflict
- **No network isolation**: All containers share the same network namespace

### Docker Compose Feature Support
- **No privileged containers**: Security limitation prevents privileged mode
- **No host networking**: Host network mode is not available
- **Limited volume types**: Some Docker volume driver types may not be supported
- **No Docker secrets with external references**: External secrets must be managed separately
- **No service scaling**: `replicas` directive is ignored

### Configuration & Build
- **No multi-stage build optimization**: Each service with build context is treated independently
- **Build args limitations**: Complex build argument scenarios may not work
- **No Docker-in-Docker**: Cannot run Docker commands inside containers
- **No BuildKit features**: Advanced Docker BuildKit features are not supported

## ‚ùì Potential Unknown Issues Summary

While the known limitations are documented, several categories of issues may emerge in production:

- **Resource contention**: Memory pressure, CPU throttling, and I/O bottlenecks from multiple containers competing for VM resources
- **Startup and dependency issues**: Race conditions in complex dependency chains, health check cascades, and circular dependency deadlocks
- **Database and state management**: Migration conflicts, connection pool exhaustion, and backup/restore complexity in multi-container environments
- **Security and isolation concerns**: Shared secret access, process visibility between containers, and file permission conflicts
- **Performance and operational challenges**: Resource starvation, log volume management, debugging complexity across containers
- **Compatibility edge cases**: Docker Compose version differences, image size limits, registry authentication, and Fly.io feature conflicts

These potential issues highlight the importance of thorough testing with realistic workloads and gradual migration strategies for production deployments.

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For Known Limitations
1. **Clear documentation** about single-VM constraints and resource sharing
2. **Validation warnings** for unsupported Docker Compose features
3. **Resource monitoring** and alerts for container resource usage
4. **Best practices guide** for multi-container application design

### For Potential Unknowns
1. **Comprehensive testing** across different Docker Compose patterns
2. **User feedback collection** to identify real-world issues
3. **Monitoring and alerting** for deployment failures and performance issues
4. **Gradual rollout** with feature flags to minimize impact

### Recommended Testing Areas
- **Resource stress testing** with multiple containers
- **Complex dependency scenarios** with circular references
- **Database-heavy workloads** with connection pooling
- **High-throughput applications** with network/disk I/O
- **Large Docker Compose files** with many services
- **Mixed architecture deployments** (ARM/x86)

This analysis should help prioritize testing efforts and prepare documentation for common issues users might encounter when migrating Docker Compose applications to Fly.io.
